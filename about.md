See those colorful numbers up there? I can't think about numbers without seeing those colors associated with each digit. I've grown to see this [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia) as my life's mission. To meld the "numbers" of technology and math with the "colors" of people in powerful new ways. To achieve the objective through the subjective.
